# üëÜ DirectIR: Training-Free Enhancement for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration via Contrastive Guidance
***Image Processing 2024 Final Project***
[Youtube DEMO LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2kIq410dEI&t=330s)
Group 5: Group-SEVEN

## Environment Setup

Follow the steps below to clone the repository, set up the environment, and install dependencies. The code is tested on **Python 3.10**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeeecheng/directIR.git
cd directIR
conda create -n directIR python=3.10 -y
conda activate directIR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

To process the default image examples, run the following command. The pre-trained model weights will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face and placed under the `checkpoints/` directory:

```bash
bash scripts/inference.sh
```
